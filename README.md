# InsulinPump
An embedded system in an insulin pump used by diabetics to maintain blood glucose control

Goals
 - Collects data from a blood sugar sensor and calculates the amount of insulin required to be injected. 
 - Calculation based on the rate of change of blood sugar levels.
 - Sends signals to a micro-pump to deliver the correct dose of insulin.
 - Safety-critical system as low blood sugars can lead to brain malfunctioning, coma and death; high-blood sugar levels have long - term consequences such as eye and kidney damage.

 - The system shall be available to deliver insulin when required.
 - The system shall perform reliably and deliver the correct amount of insulin to counteract the current level of blood sugar.
 - The system must therefore be designed and implemented to ensure that the system always meets these requirements.
